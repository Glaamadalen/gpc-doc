Ahead of this year's Olympics, we want to show small parts of the system that perhaps not everyone has noticed. 
Some of you may not have participated in previous Olympics? Here there are opportunities to be prepared.

## Types of exercises

<ExerciseTypeList lng="en" />

## Timer exercises

Most timer exercises will have a limit to how long you can use. When this is the case, you will get a countdown at the top of the page. 
It is important here to stop the task BEFORE the time runs out. If you take too long, you will not get points.

Even if the timer you see counts down to 0, you still need to scan the stop to be able to move on to the next task.

In cases where we have not set a time limit, you will be shown the start time on the task page.

To ensure that the exercise has started before you start, you will receive the last important information after starting.

Should you not be able to complete the task, you can press give up and move on to the next task. Of course, we hope that all tasks will be solvable.

## Attributes

New this year, and a small experiment for us, are attributes to the exercises. To begin with, we have these.

## Other usefull stuff

In the menu you can find a list of all 'Exercises', In this list you will quickly see which exercises are in progress (**Blue**), interrupted (**Red**) and completed (**Green**). 

You will also find 'Program' for the day. If you are unsure where to find the exercises in the area, you will find it out on the 'Map'. 

The most important thing for the day, as the entire system is based on QR codes, is a 'QR reader'. This is built into the system, but if you prefer, you can also use an desired APP on your phone.



For large parts of the day, you can follow the 'Scoreboard', but we will close this towards the end of the day. We want to have some excitement in who wins gold
