We started the year with a long board meeting where we distributed tasks and discussed the way forward. It takes time and effort to create such a large event!

Approval was given by the reviewers to be allowed to submit and publish the event 6 months before, thank you very much for this! In this way, we hope to reach more people and that it will be easier for those who want to participate to plan their weekend/holiday well in advance.

We have new tasks, but we have also taken care of some classics and put a twist on them, so those of you who have been there before may recognize something.

Otherwise, most things will look and work as they did in 2022, hopefully even better, as we have come together and discussed what we need to change or remove/add for everything to go well.

Of course, there are never any guarantees, but we hope people understand that ðŸ˜Š We do the best we can, and wish and hope that this will be another super cache party with good memories and lots of nice smiles!

If there is anyone out there who would like to volunteer, either part of the day or the whole day, please get in touch! We are a very small group, and it takes a lot of resources to organize something this big. So we welcome all the help we can get! This could be standing in the kiosk, preparing/cooking food, being on duty at the tasks, cleaning up after the event, etc.

It costs nothing to join, but we hold a raffle and a kiosk to try not to go into the red. So if you have the opportunity to support us by buying lottery tickets, you are helping to keep GPC alive, maybe there will be something in 2026 too?

We look forward to it, see you?
