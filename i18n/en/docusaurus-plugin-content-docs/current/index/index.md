# The history of GPC

Glaamadalens Plastikbeholderes Cacheleker started to sprout in Olet's head, he wanted to create a Cache Olympics that no one had seen before, with subtleties, tasks and a separate website that would keep track of points, teams and tasks for us. The board of GPS fell head over heels for the idea and immediately had full confidence in his knowledge to create this website. (We couldn't imagine how GOOD it would be, so intricate and well made it is!) GPS2019 was born!
